    "*What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?*  \n",

    "From the heatmap titled \"Percentile ranks of samples' category spending,\" we can see that this sample represents an establishment that spends very little on `Frozen` category as compared to other product categories. Furthermore, this kind of establishment also spends significantly on `Milk`, at eighty-three percentile to be exact. My intuition leads me to think that this *might* be a **market**. \n",

On the other categories, their spending is at well over the seventieth percentile range. My intuition leads me to believe this might be a place that serves meals and offers lodgings like a **hotel** or a **university** with a residence halls and adjoining cafetaria. \n",
    "___ \n",
    "##### Sample 2 \n",
    "This establishment spends significantly on all categories with the exception of the `Detergents_Paper` category where their spending is limited to the fifty-eight percentile. My guess is that this sample represents a **wholesale retailer** like a \"costco\" or \"Sam's club\""

    "### Implementation: Feature Relevance\n",
    "One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.\n",
    " - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
